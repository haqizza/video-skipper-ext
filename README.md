# Simple Video Skipper Chrome Extension

![Extension](/icon.png)

Since Youtsube (ようつべ) is blocking the video player after 3 video when using ad blocker (01/11/23), it's been so frustrating. I don't want to listen to the music played or watch the ad video. So, This extension (bi ithnillah) may help you (me) to skip the ad by setting the current time to the end of the video without triggering the ad blocker-blocker.

Maybe there are many similiar extension in the [chrome web store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions), but I want to create it myself.
